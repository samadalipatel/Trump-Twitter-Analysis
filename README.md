# Trump-Twitter-Analysis
The purpose of this workbook was to analyzing the text data of Trump's tweets from November 7th, 2016 (the day before the election) until now. 

# Major Conclusions
There has been much reported about Trump's television habits, even in the White House - most notably that he spends a significant portion of each day watching primetime news about himself. This data, along with other sources, can verify those reports. 

Bob Woodward notes in his new book, "Fear: Trump in the White House" that The President does not typically begin his work day until 10-11 A.M. His sleep schedule is all over the place, as evidenced by the fact that he frequently tweets well into the early morning. 

The key information found is that the vast majority of time Trump mentions Fox and Friends and CNN is early in the morning throughout these channels' morning programming. Clearly Trump is watching television at these hours and then speaking publicly based on the reporting he views. 


Additionally, Trump has a clear habit of utilizing rhetoric that successfully got him elected well-into his presidency. This is evidenced by the fact that President Obama and Hillary Clinton are still among the people he mentions the most. 


# Final Note
This brief workbook inspired me to combine the discoveries here with common ML algorithms to try and predict the performance of Trump's tweets. That work can be found here:https://github.com/samadalipatel/Trump-Twitter-Predictions
